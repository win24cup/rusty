## How To Play

When a player starts a new video poker game, the first thing to do is place a bet and then, he will be dealt 5 cards. In order to achieve the strongest winning hand, the player can choose to keep some cards and exchange others. This is easily done by selecting each card you wish to hold and click on the Deal/Draw button. The decision which cards to keep and which to replace with new ones will make the difference between winning and losing the round. Of course, the goal should always be winning more coins than you originally bet.
